# Final Project

Create your own files for your final project. Feel free to visit office hours if you're not sure what files to create, or how to name them.

## React

Using React isn't required, but it's recommended if you're up to the challenge. You can create your React application here by opening a terminal window in this folder, and running this command:

```
create-react-app .
```

The `.` in this case refers to the current folder -- normally `create-react-app` assumes that you're giving it a project name, and it creates a corresponding folder.
